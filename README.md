# Machine-Learning-Classifiers

Welcome to Machine-Learning-Classifiers, a project that explores the power of decision trees, logistic regression, and confusion matrix in machine learning.

## Description

Machine-Learning-Classifiers is a Python-based project that aims to showcase the implementation and evaluation of popular machine-learning algorithms. This project demonstrates the usage of decision trees and logistic regression classifiers, along with the evaluation of model performance using the confusion matrix.

## Features

- Decision Tree: Explore how decision trees can be used to make predictions and understand the decision-making process in classification tasks.
- Logistic Regression: Understand the basics of logistic regression and its application as a classification algorithm.
- Confusion Matrix: Evaluate the performance of your classifiers using the confusion matrix, gaining insights into true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
